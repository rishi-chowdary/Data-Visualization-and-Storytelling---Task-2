## Project Overview

This project is part of a Data Analyst Internship and focuses on visual storytelling using Amazon product review data. The primary objective is to clean, analyze, and visualize customer reviews to extract meaningful insights using **Tableau**.

## 🔍 Objective

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

The raw dataset underwent the following cleaning steps:

- Removed missing/null entries.
- Converted review dates into datetime format.
- Standardized text (e.g., lowercase conversion, punctuation removal).
- Removed duplicate entries.
- Filtered out irrelevant fields and focused on key metrics: `reviewText`, `overall`, `verified`, etc.

## 📈 Visualizations Created

1. **Rating Distribution** – Breakdown of review scores (1 to 5).
2. **Verified vs. Non-Verified Reviews** – Comparison of review authenticity.
3. **Word Cloud** – Most frequent words in review texts.
4. **Review Trends Over Time** – Temporal analysis of review counts.
5. **Sentiment Overview** – Insights into customer satisfaction.

## 📖 Tableau Story Highlights

The Tableau story provides a guided visual narrative that walks stakeholders through:
